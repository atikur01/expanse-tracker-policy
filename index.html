    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Expense Tracker Pro</strong> is an offline-first expense tracking application. This privacy policy
        describes how your personal information is handled in <strong>Expense Tracker Pro</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>We do not collect any personal data</h2>
    <p>
        I do not collect, use, save, or have access to any of your personal data recorded in Expense Tracker Pro.
        Individual settings relating to the Expense Tracker Pro app are not personal and are stored only on your device.
        You might also be asked to provide access to your photo library or camera, but this is only to attach receipts
        to your expense entries locally.
        We do not process that information at all and have no access to it.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
        All data entered in the app is stored locally on your device's internal storage.
        We do not have any servers, and we do not transmit your data to any external locations.
        When you delete the app, all data stored within the app is permanently deleted from your device.
    </p>

    <h2>App Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app requires the following permissions to function:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Used to store your expense data and transaction records locally on your device.
        </li>
 
    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
        We take the security of your data seriously. We use secure storage mechanisms provided by the operating system
        (such as iOS Keychain and Android Keystore) to store sensitive information like your PIN code.
